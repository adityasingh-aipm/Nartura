You are a senior full-stack engineer and UX designer building the entry flow and home screen for Nurtura, an AI parenting app built on React + TailwindCSS with Supabase for basic user tracking.

🎯 GOAL

Build a mobile-first parent entry screen that:

Collects only mobile number OR email ID to identify the parent (no OTP needed yet).

Displays trust copy like “Trusted by thousands of parents.”

On successful entry, redirects to the child setup screen, where parent adds baby name and selects baby’s age group (from a predefined list).

After onboarding, shows a Home page with “Add New Baby” button at top-right.

⚙️ TECH REQUIREMENTS

Framework: React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Supabase

Data: store parent’s identifier (mobile/email) and baby’s data in Supabase.

Use @supabase/supabase-js client:

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY);
export default supabase;


Save data to two tables:

parents → { id, contact_info }

babies → { id, parent_id, name, age_group }
