## TONE & COPY GUIDELINES

**DO:**
- Use first names (parent & baby)

- Speak like a caring friend, not a doctor

**DON'T:**
- Use jargon or medical language

- Overload with options
- Use aggressive CTA language

**Sample Copy:**
- ✅ "Let's cuddle up for 10 minutes and grow together 💕"
- ❌ "Initiate bonding activity sequence"
- ✅ "You just unlocked a new growth milestone! 🌱"
- ❌ "Developmental milestone achieved"
- ✅ "Gathering little moments of growth…"
