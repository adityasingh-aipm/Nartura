# Replit Prompt: Transform Your Parenting Journey - Challenges Section

## Context
We're redesigning the "Transform Your Parenting Journey" challenges section on a parenting app landing page. The current design displays multiple challenge cards but needs optimization for layout, spacing, and card uniformity.

## Design Changes Required

### 1. CTA Button Repositioning
- Move the "Challenges Now Live" pink pill-shaped CTA button to the top-right corner of the section
- Keep its pink color (#FF1493 or similar) and circular pill design
- Position it above the section title using absolute or flex positioning

### 2. Challenge Card Structure (4 Total)
Update to display exactly 4 challenge cards in a single row (or responsive grid):
- **30-Day Challenge**: "30-Day Connection Spark"
  - Icon: Star/sparkle icon (orange)
  - Tagline: "Ignite Daily Joy & Wonder"
  - Description: Brief text about transforming ordinary moments into memories

- **90-Day Challenge**: "90-Day Heart-to-Heart Habit"
  - Icon: Heart icon (red/pink)
  - Tagline: "Transform Moments Into Rituals"
  - Description: Brief text about turning connection into daily superpower

- **180-Day Challenge**: "180-Day Journey"
  - Icon: Rainbow/growth icon (multicolor)
  - Tagline: "Build Lifetime Connection"
  - Description: Brief text about deep, sustained growth

- **365-Day Challenge**: "Year-Round Growth"
  - Icon: Calendar/cycle icon (gold)
  - Tagline: "Transform Your Parenting Forever"
  - Description: Brief text about full-year transformation

### 3. Uniform Card Size
- Make all 4 cards the exact same height and width
- Set fixed dimensions (recommend: ~280px width x ~360px height, adjust as needed)
- Ensure icon areas are consistent in size and positioning
- Align "View Challenge" buttons at the bottom with consistent padding

### 4. Reduce Whitespace
- Reduce the gap/margin between the previous section and the "Transform Your Parenting Journey" section
- Current spacing appears to be ~60-80px; reduce to ~30-40px
- Maintain visual hierarchy while improving visual flow

### 5. Responsive Design
- Desktop: Show all 4 cards in one row
- Tablet: Show 2 cards per row
- Mobile: Stack cards vertically (1 per row)
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox with appropriate gap values
